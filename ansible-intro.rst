Getting to know Ansible
=========================

To get to know Ansible, we're going to rely on `some

along with some live examples in your OpenShift cluster. You'll be
running these commands from your cluster's bastion host, which is
already configured with Ansible and an inventory that references your
OpenShift cluster.
